## Brain Tumor Classification _ CNN

This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying brain tumors from
MRI images into four categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. The dataset used
consists of grayscale MRI scans labeled accordingly, and the goal is to automate early tumor detection to
assist radiologists and improve diagnostic accuracy
